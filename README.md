The Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT) is a top level Eclipse project

As an Eclipse project, BIRT is built for extensibility.  Developers can customize BIRT to support custom controls and behavior through BIRT extension points.  The ReportItem allows developers to add new controls to the standard BIRT Palette.  These controls can then be easily included to reports using standard drag and drop techniques.

This project consists of two new BIRT controls.

When building reports, it is very easy to overload report users with numbers.  The <b>DotBar</b> gives a quick visual representation of numeric values.  The control supports wrapping in easily countable values and either a vertical or horizontal orientation.<br>
<br>
The control supports multiple shapes (dots, triangles, and squares), colors, and fonts to improve user accessibility.<br>

Rotating text within a report is useful when trying to conserve space on the page.  The standard BIRT palette does not support rotated text.</blockquote>

Based on example code from the BIRT repository, the <b>RotatedText</b> control provides a production ready implementation that you can use in your project.  This implementation includes support for font, color, line wrapping and hyper-links.<br>

This project will provide production ready controls that give your report developers new items to effectively communicate through their reports.  In addition, this project provides best practice implementations that can be used to create your own BIRT ReportItem  extensions.
