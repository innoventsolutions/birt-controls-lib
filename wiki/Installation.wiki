The easiest way to get this plugin is to use the Eclipse Update Manager.  

This project shares an update manager with several other sites, but the update site allows
you to pick and choose and only grab the plugins that you want.  To use the update manager:

Go to Help - Software Updates - Available Software

Click on *Manage Sites* then *Add* 

Paste this URL in the text box that asks for site 
{{{
 http://innovent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/update
}}}
You should now have the Innovent BIRT Plugins update site.  

If you only want this plugin, open the tree view and select only the *BIRT Controls* checkbox.
