	The first step is to insure that the plugins have been installed on your system.  If you look in the palette view you should see both the DotBar and the
	RotatedText control listed at the end of the ReportItems section.  (see right). 
	
	If you do not see the controls, then there is an issue in your plugin installation.  Please verify that the both the:
	* bb.birt.controls.jar
	* bb.birt.controls.ui.jar 
	Are available in the $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins directory of your application.
