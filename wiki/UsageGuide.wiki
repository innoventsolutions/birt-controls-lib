This project generates two new !ReportItem components, the !RotatedTextItem and !DotBar.
The project is split into two separate plugins:
* bb-birt-controls
* bb-birt-controls-ui
If you create ReportItem extensions you should split your UI components from the engine only components.
The UI components have dependencies to the Eclipse UI plugins.  These UI components are not published
in the ReportEngine distributions.  

If you combine both the UI and engine components into a single plugin, you will have load 
errors when you try to deploy the plugin to a BIRT runtime instance.
